# AirBnB Clone

## Overview

The AirBnB Clone is a web application that simulates the functionality of the popular rental platform, AirBnB. This project serves as a learning experience in building a full-stack application using Python, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL. It encompasses a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the application's data models.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Interact with the application using commands to create, update, show, destroy, and list instances.
- **Data Models**: Implemented using Python classes, including `User`, `Place`, `Review`, `City`, `State`, and `Amenity`.
- **Storage Engines**: Supports both File Storage and DB Storage (using MySQL).
